## Prompt Management System and Bug Fixes

Today we implemented a comprehensive prompt management system and fixed several issues in the application.

### 1. Complete Prompt Management System

Enhanced the prompts functionality with a full CRUD system:

- **Backend Improvements**:
  - Added ID field to prompt models for reliable tracking and operations
  - Created new endpoints for updating (`PUT /api/v1/prompts/{prompt_id}`) and deleting (`DELETE /api/v1/prompts/{prompt_id}`) prompts
  - Updated the prompt service to handle operations by ID
  - Modified existing endpoints to work with the new ID-based structure

- **Frontend Implementation**:
  - Created a comprehensive PromptList component to display all prompts
  - Implemented add, edit, and delete functionality with proper UI feedback
  - Added confirmation dialog for safe prompt deletion
  - Enhanced the AddPromptModal to support both adding and editing operations

- **Code Architecture**:
  - Split code into smaller, focused components (PromptItem, AddPromptModal, DeleteConfirmationModal)
  - Created a dedicated promptService for API calls
  - Improved separation of concerns throughout the application

### 2. Code Cleanup and Organization

Improved codebase organization and fixed import issues:

- Deleted unused `Sources.tsx` component and its folder
- Fixed import path issues with the Toast component
- Reorganized component structure for better maintainability

### 3. Bug Fixes

Fixed critical issues in the application:

- **Summary Generation Error**:
  - Updated the fetchSummaryPrompt function to work with the renamed "Generate Summary" prompt
  - Modified the function to fetch all prompts and find the correct one by name
  - Added proper error handling with specific error messages
  - Improved validation for each step of the summary generation process

### Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive tests for the prompt management system
2. Consider implementing a toast notification system for user feedback
3. Improve error handling throughout the application
4. Add support for more prompt templates for different types of summaries

### Technical Details

All changes have been committed with proper documentation and comments. The application now provides a complete system for managing prompts with proper error handling and user feedback.
