## PDF Processing and Summary Service Enhancements

Today we made several improvements to the PDF processing capabilities and cleaned up the codebase structure.

### 1. New Raw Content Extraction Feature

Added a new endpoint `/pdf/content-raw` that extracts text from PDFs without page separation:

- Created `PDFRawContent` model for text-only response
- Implemented `extract_raw_content` method in `PDFContentService`
- Added text cleanup to remove extra whitespace and newlines
- Maintains same input parameters as existing content endpoint (start_page, end_page)

### 2. Code Structure Cleanup

Removed unnecessary `__init__.py` files to modernize the codebase:

- Removed empty `__init__.py` files from:
  - `/app`
  - `/app/summary`
  - `/app/summary/models`
  - `/app/summary/routers`
  - `/app/summary/services`
- Leveraging Python 3.x namespace packages
- All imports remain absolute and working (e.g., `from app.routers import chat`)

### 3. OpenAI Integration Fixes

Fixed configuration issues with the OpenAI model selection:

- Corrected typo in default model name from "gpt-4o" to "gpt-4"
- Clarified model selection hierarchy:
  1. Request-specific model (if provided)
  2. Environment variable configuration
  3. Default fallback to "gpt-4"

### 4. Summary Service Updates

Enhanced the prompt template for generating summaries:

- Updated format to use clear section headers
- Added structured bullet points for key ideas
- Improved readability of generated summaries
- Maintained academic tone and depth of analysis

### Next Steps

1. Consider adding model selection to `SummaryRequest` for flexibility
2. Add tests for the new raw content extraction feature
3. Monitor performance with the corrected GPT-4 model

### Technical Details

All changes have been committed with proper documentation and comments. The application maintains backward compatibility while providing new features for better text extraction and processing.
